00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
So, we have five options in this quiz.

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.904
The first one, is asking to move

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:10.250
the documents/books directory into the documents directory.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.320
But, that's where it already is,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.005
so that won't do anything.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:15.960
The second one will do just fine.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.225
It'll move each file from documents/books into documents, so that one's good.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:25.155
The third one has a CD into documents and then move

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:31.080
all the epub files from the books' subdirectory into the current directory,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.804
which is to say the documents directory,

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:34.289
so that one works too.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.579
The fourth one has a CD into documents/books and then

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.439
move all of the files in that directory into the parent directory which is documents.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.009
So, that'll be fine too.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.000
And as for this last one, well,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.019
you see how the star is inside the single quotes?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.760
That's asking the shell to look for a file whose name is literally documents/books/star.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.500
And there isn't one of those,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.349
so that won't work.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.329
Remember that the single quotes indicate that

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.719
a special character should be treated as non-special and in this case,

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.685
we want star to be treated specially.

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:15.120
So, any of these three will work fine.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.000
Do be aware though, that they will leave your shell in a different working directory.
