00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.129
a little programming language.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.660
And just like JavaScript or
Python, it has variables.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.699
They look a little
different, though.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.419
In the Shell, whenever you
create or modify a variable,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.800
you just give its
name and an equal sign

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.230
followed by the value
that you want it to have.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.050
Note, that you can't put any
spaces around the equal sign.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.600
Then when you want to
refer to the variable,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.320
you put a dollar sign
in front of its name.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.100
There are actually
two different kinds

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.900
of variables in the Shell.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.739
One of them is called
a Shell variable.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.469
The lines and columns
variables that you saw earlier

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.719
are this kind.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.299
These are just internal to
the Shell program itself.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:44.829
The other kind is called
an environment variable.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.259
Environment variables
are shared with programs

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:48.969
that you run from
within the Shell.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.670
One environment variable
that's really important

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.020
is the Path variable.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.480
That tells your system where
your Program Files are.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.329
So when you type a
command such as ls,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.519
it can find the
program to run it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.680
For instance, on my system
the ls program is in /bin.ls.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.810
So it's in the /bin directory.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.530
And the /bin directory is
here in my path variable.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.299
The directories in
the path variable

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.280
are separated by colons.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.430
And the Shell searches them
starting with the first one,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.890
and then proceeding to
the right until it finds

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.950
the command that you entered.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.450
And that's how the Shell is
able to find the ls command when

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.656
I want to run it.

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:29.030
You'll sometimes
see instructions

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.489
telling you to add a
directory to your path

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.739
so that programs
in it can be found.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.809
To add the new directory
to the end of your path,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.430
you do it like this--

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.150
PATH=$PATH: and then
the new directory.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.120
But if you do it like this
right at the Shell prompt,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.039
that change will only last
until you close the Shell.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.829
We'll take a look at
where you do it if you

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.780
want to keep that change.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.590
But first, a couple of quizzes.
