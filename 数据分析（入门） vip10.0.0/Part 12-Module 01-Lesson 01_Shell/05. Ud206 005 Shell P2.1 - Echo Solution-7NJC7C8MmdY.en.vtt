00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
The dollar symbol in front of a word indicates that it is a shell variable.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:14.009
The command echo $COLUMNS X $LINES prints out the size of your terminal.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.620
Now 80 x 24 is a really common size.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.190
Mine's a little bit wider than that because this is a wide screen video.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.120
But if you resize the terminal,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.970
these variables will change.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.199
We'll see a lot more about shell variables later in this course.
