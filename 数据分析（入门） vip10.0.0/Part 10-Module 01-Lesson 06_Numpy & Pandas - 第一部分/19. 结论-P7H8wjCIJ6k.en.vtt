00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.650
Congratulations, you
finished the lesson.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.120
You learned how to use Numpy and
Pandas to analyze one-dimensional data

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.310
using code that's cleaner and
runs faster, great job.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.360
In the next lesson,
you'll build on what you've learned and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.400
start analyzing two-dimensional data.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.950
I'll see you then.
