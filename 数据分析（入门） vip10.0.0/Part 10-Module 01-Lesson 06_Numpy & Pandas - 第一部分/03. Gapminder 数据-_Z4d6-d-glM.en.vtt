00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.210
Throughout this lesson, I'm going
to use examples from a new dataset

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.080
which contains information about
employment levels, life expectancy, GDP,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.520
and school completion rates
in various countries.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.400
This data was collected by the site
Gapminder which is linked in

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.900
the instructor notes.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.290
In this lesson I won't be going through
the data analysis process in order,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.720
since I want to focus on how to
use NumPy and Pandas effectively.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.740
Instead you'll be doing a bunch
of analysis on this dataset, but

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.680
not necessarily in order.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.600
I still want you to start off by
thinking of some questions though.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.320
In the downloadable section there
is a file which explains what

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.390
data is available in more detail.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.570
Take a look at that file and

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.440
try to think of at least five questions
that you could answer using this data.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.220
Then share the questions you thought of
with your classmates on the forums, and

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.510
when you're done, check these boxes.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.150
The csv files containing the actual
data are also available in

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.660
the downloadable section,
if you'd like to take a look.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.070
But that shouldn't be necessary
since you'll be able to complete all

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.290
the programming exercises in this
lesson within the Udacity editor.
