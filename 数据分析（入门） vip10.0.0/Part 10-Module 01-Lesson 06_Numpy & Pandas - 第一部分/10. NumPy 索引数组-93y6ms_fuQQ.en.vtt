00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.180
The first thing I want to do
is create an array of booleans

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.570
indicating whether each student
cancelled in the first week.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.390
I'll call the array is_paid and it will
contain true for students who remained

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.050
enrolled for at least seven days before
cancelling and false for others.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.580
I can create this array
using vectorized operations

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.520
by comparing the days_to_cancel
array to the value 7.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.310
Then I'll create an array
called paid_time.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.440
Which includes the time spent for
each student, but

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.910
only including paid students.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.500
To keep only the paid students,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.100
I'll us is paid as an index
array into time spent.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.990
Finally I'll take the mean of
this array to get the mean time

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.290
spent by paid students.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.140
And this code could actually all be
simplified down to a single line.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.540
And again,
once you're used to index arrays and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.930
vectorized operations, I think this
line of code is very clear and concise.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.720
It says look at the time spent for
each student, but only for

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.810
students who stayed enrolled at
least seven days before cancelling.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.210
And then take the mean of that time.
