00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.710
Here's a query I use to try to
find the answer to this problem.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.530
Pandas add two series without nans.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.490
And it looks like the first
result is about adding pandas

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.470
series with different
indices without getting nans.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.500
That sounds like what I'm wondering.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.660
The first answer on this page
suggests using the fill value and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.760
some sample code is provided.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.951
In the example code,
I can see that the person who posted,

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:26.292
is advocating using the .add function,
instead of the +.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:30.913
And then the .add function can
take an argument, fill_value=0.

00:00:30.913 --> 00:00:33.746
So I'll try that out
on these two series.

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:36.540
And it looks like the result is
exactly what I was hoping for.
