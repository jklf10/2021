00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.610
Here's another question, suppose you
multiply a vector by a single number,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.884
also called a scalar.

00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:08.403
What would you expect the result to be?

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.570
I've added some options here.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.260
Again, there's no right or wrong answer.
