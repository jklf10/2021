00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.240
The argmax function on the panda
series returns the index

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.750
where the maximum value occurred.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.550
In this case,
the index will be the country name.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.380
Then to find the value
corresponding to that country,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.230
I'll use the loc attribute.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.020
And it'll auto return the country and
the value.
