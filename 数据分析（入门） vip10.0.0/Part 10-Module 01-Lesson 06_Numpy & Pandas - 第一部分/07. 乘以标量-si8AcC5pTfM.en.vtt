00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.500
Again, these are all reasonable answers.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.410
The first, this is what Python does.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.600
It creates a list with all the values
from the original list repeated

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.540
three times.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.580
One, two, three.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.490
The second is the behavior you
get in both linear algebra and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.020
with NumPy arrays.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.320
The first element of the original vector
was multiplied by 3 to get the first

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.730
element of the result.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.810
The second was also multiplied by 3 and
the third was multiplied by 3.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.220
And again,
the third option is very common.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.240
Many programming languages would
not allow you to multiply a list or

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.220
an array by a number.
