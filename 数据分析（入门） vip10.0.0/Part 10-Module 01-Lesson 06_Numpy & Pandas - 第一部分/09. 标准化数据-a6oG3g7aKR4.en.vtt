00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.410
Again, I'll first think about how
to standardize a single data point,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.689
say the value at position zero.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.260
First, I'll calculate the distance
of that value from the mean,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.100
which I can do by subtracting.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.680
Then to convert to a number
of standard deviations,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.640
I'll need to divide by
the standard deviation.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.970
And again,
parentheses are important here.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.440
So this will calculate
a single standardized value.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.920
And I could use a loop to
standardize all the values, but

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.690
instead I'm going to use
vectorized operations.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.759
Again, vectorized operations make the
code to operate on an entire array very

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.130
similar to the code that
operates on a single value.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.690
I'll simply change this
variable from a single value

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.010
to the entire array of values.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.090
Now values is the entire array, and
the mean is still a single number.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
So this subtraction subtracts the mean
from each value in the array.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.100
Then the standard deviation
is still a single number, so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.180
this division divides each element of
the array by the standard deviation.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.410
And since this standardized all the
values in the array, I will change this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.580
variable to standardized values,
and I'll delete this line.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.070
And finally,
I will return the standardized values.
