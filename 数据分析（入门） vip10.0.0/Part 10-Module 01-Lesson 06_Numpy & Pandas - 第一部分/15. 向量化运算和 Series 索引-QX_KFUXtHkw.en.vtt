00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.720
Series indexes have an interesting
effect on vectorized operations.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.560
When you add two NumPy arrays,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.240
you're adding up elements of the same
position since there is no index.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.990
Now, for
the series that you've added up so

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.530
far, the positions and
indexes have been the same.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.110
What do you think happens
if that's not the case?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.820
And if you were to add based on index
rather than position, what do you think

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.790
would happen if you were to add up two
series that had different indexes?

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.940
Try it out and see.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.470
On the next screen you'll see code to
add a few different Pandas series with

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.810
with different indexes.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.050
Take a look at the results and
see if you can figure out the pattern.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.040
Once you have a theory about how
vectorized operations work for

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.380
Pandas series, watch the solution
video to see if you are correct.
