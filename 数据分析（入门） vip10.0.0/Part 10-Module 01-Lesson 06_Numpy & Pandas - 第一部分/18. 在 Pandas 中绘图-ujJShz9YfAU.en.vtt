00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
We've provided a code for you to load each variable into something called a data frame,

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:05.755
which you'll learn about next lesson.

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:10.735
Then this code extracted a series from each data frame corresponding to the US only.

00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:13.935
If you wanted to examine a country other than the United States,

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.765
you could have changed this value.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.100
Now to make my plots,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.620
I'll add the one percent pylab inline to

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.205
make my plots appear within the IPython Notebook,

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:25.695
but if you're not using IPython Notebook you wouldn't have added this line.

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:30.570
And then I can plot the employment in the US by calling employment_us.plot.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.160
Here, I can see that the years,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.835
which are the indexes of the series have been filled in on the x-axis,

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.325
and the employment values have been filled in on the y-axis.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:42.680
And the same code would work for the other variables.
