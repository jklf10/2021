00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.240
In the last lesson, you did a bunch
of data analysis using Python.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.689
And you did use NumPy and
matplotlib a bit, but for the most part,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.150
you completed the analysis without
using any additional libraries.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.120
In this lesson, you're going to get
a lot more familiar with NumPy.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.110
And I'll also introduce you
to a library called pandas.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.290
Both of these libraries,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.130
especially Pandas take a little
time to learn how to use.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.640
But once you do, they'll make writing
data analysis code a lot easier.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.590
And your code will also run
faster when you use them.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.330
When I first started using Pandas,
I spent a lot of time reading online

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.640
documentation, going through tutorials
and I found it really difficult.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.170
This course contains the information
I wish I'd had when I started out.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.350
I won't be able to cover every feature
that you might want to use, but

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.260
by the end, you'll be better equipped
to read the documentation and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.880
learn more on your own.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.370
In this lesson, I'll be focusing on
using NumPy and Pandas to analyze one

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.910
dimensional data, so something like
a single column of a spreadsheet.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.560
Let's get started
