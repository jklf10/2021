00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.940
Here are some questions I thought
of that I'm interested in.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.390
First, how has employment
in the US varied over time?

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.330
Of course, you could ask the same
question about another country.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.520
I'm particularly interested in the US,
because that's where I live.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.790
But you may have another country
you're interested in investigating.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.790
In the most recent year we have data on,
what are the highest and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.550
lowest employment levels
out of all the countries?

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.030
Which countries have
those employment levels?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.730
And where is the US on that spectrum?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970
Of course,
I could ask these same questions for

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.550
any of the other variables
in the data set, as well.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.160
I'm also interested in whether there are
any consistent trends across countries.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.800
For example, have there been
any global recessions and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.310
if so, can I find them in this data?

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.270
Answering this last question would be
a bit complicated and we're not going

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.510
to get into it in this lesson, but
we can definitely tackle the others.
