00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
In terms of your work at Facebook,

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.260
what are some recent projects that you've been working on?

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.350
So, one thing I'm really fascinated by is how information flows through networks.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.750
So, in my early work this was just how web pages link together,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.170
but with online social networks being such a prevalent means of communicating these days,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.320
there's a lot of transmission from individual to individual,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.510
from individual to their social network,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.455
and there are these things called memes which are ideas that

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:35.895
seem to almost take advantage of this to replicate themselves.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:38.970
So, some Facebook status updates for example,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.375
will have a little piece of text that says,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.895
"Copy and paste or re-post

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:50.730
or post this so that all your friends will see if you agree with the statement."

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.810
One interesting thing about memes is that they tend to recur over time,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.210
so sometimes you see meme and it's like,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.000
"Oh yeah, I saw that one a year ago, now it's back."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.320
And how does it come back?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.275
So, we looked at one particular meme,

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:08.250
this is the money bags meme which says that, "This year,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.535
October has five Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays",

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:14.520
this happens only once every 823 years,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.365
and this is a lucky occurrence, bla,bla,bla.

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:18.615
And anyone who actually looks it up sees that

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.630
this kind of occurrence is much more frequent, and in fact,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
you'll have different variance of the mean, for example,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.460
here in red you have the one that says,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.410
"July has five Friday,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.095
Saturday, Sundays", and this is true in 2011.

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:34.605
And if you just look at this plot which will

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:38.129
on a linear scale show you the counts for this meme,

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:41.350
it may appear as though it just disappears completely in between.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.310
So, you might think well, maybe it's being introduced

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.180
from some other source and not Facebook,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.270
but the weird thing is that the meme is adapted to Facebook,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.385
it says "Copy and paste",

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:56.190
which doesn't make so much sense for other media.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.570
So, is it possible that the meme is actually staying within Facebook,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.975
but in very low numbers, and then flares up?

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:06.540
Instead of using a linear scale,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.890
use a log scale.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.650
Here at the same time you can see counts that are 100,000 and counts that are ten.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.480
And so, here when you look you can see that

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.510
even though there's a rapid decay and interests,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.965
it actually looks like it's maybe power-law,

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:25.335
and you can see the meme persisting in low numbers,

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:28.405
and then different variants perhaps being prompted

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:33.385
by a resurgence of this meme then subsequently occurring.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:38.590
These were done in ggplot just with a simple line geome,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.970
and grouping by their particular meme variant,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.280
and then re-scaling the y-axis to log in one of the versions.
