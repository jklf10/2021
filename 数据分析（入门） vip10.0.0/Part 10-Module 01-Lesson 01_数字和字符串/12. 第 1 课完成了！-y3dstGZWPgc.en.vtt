00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
Nice work so far. You're starting to get to know

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.333
Python syntax and use data types including integers,

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.322
booleans, floats, and strings.

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:10.575
You've called some of Python's built-in functions,

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.575
compared values, and assigned values to variables.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:17.215
All of these goals will be useful as you continue to learn and program in Python.

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:19.905
Next, you'll start to write your own programs,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:22.920
complete with functions and conditional statements.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.330
We'll see you in the next section.
