00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.935
We've used several useful string methods so far,

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:04.475
but where did they come from?

00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:08.590
You can learn which methods the different types offer in Python's official documentation.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.145
Here's the count method we just used.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:16.160
Notice how the documentation mentions two optional arguments, start and end.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.330
You can use these to limit the counts to occurrences

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.955
that appear within specified sections of a string.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.755
Throughout the documentation,

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:26.160
optional arguments are indicated with square brackets like these.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.275
Any arguments surrounded by square brackets are optional.

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:31.835
The documentation tends to be terse and precise,

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:33.960
but it's your most valuable resource.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.400
Don't be afraid to use it.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.760
Try out some of the other string methods that are listed in the documentation.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.370
I've included a link to this section of the docs below this video.
