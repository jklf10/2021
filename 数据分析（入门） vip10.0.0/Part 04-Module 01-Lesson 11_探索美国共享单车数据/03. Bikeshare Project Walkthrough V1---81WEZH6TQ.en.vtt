00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.490
Hi, everyone. I am here today to show you how

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.200
an ending version of the Bikeshare Project could work.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.760
And to do that,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.924
we're going to look at two different examples because there are actually

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:25.480
multiple ways that you could build something that would

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.155
pass the rubric items specific for this project.

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:32.268
And, essentially, there's a template that's provided to you,

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:35.125
but you should feel free to change that template however you would like to.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:39.505
So the function definitions and things that are provided in there,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.325
you can use as they are,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:45.615
but if something doesn't make sense to how you imagine you're ending project working,

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.895
feel free to change the inputs to it,

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.485
change what it returns.

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:52.860
The main thing is that you get an ending prototype,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.315
an ending portfolio project working in a way where

00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:02.250
it interacts with the user and provides the information that are asked within the rubric.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.315
So with that, I'm going to take a look at two solutions.

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:09.090
So one is the solution.py file,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.475
and the other is a bikeshare.py file,

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:14.700
and these are both correct solutions to what

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.830
a final project might look like for the Bikeshare Project.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.488
If we were to run the bikeshare.py project,

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:27.395
it says, "Which city would you like to see data from?"

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.990
And let's say I say Chicago.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.080
And then says, "Would you like to filter the data by month,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.180
day, both, or not at all?"

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.400
Type none for no time filter.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.445
You can see that this asks for each of these,

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:44.120
which wasn't specified in the original filter provided by

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.740
the template but this was an advanced feature that was provided in the solution.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.630
So let's say I say both,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.920
and it says "Which month?"

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.750
And I'll say February.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.200
And then which day? Please give it as an integer.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.390
Let's say 3. Cool. So it says the most popular hour

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.745
was 17 with a count of 723 when you did this filter.

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:12.900
The total duration was this, a count of this.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.655
The average duration was here.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.636
Again, the filter was both.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.600
Calculated the most popular station,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.565
so the most popular start station was here with a count of 122.

00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:26.190
The most popular end station was here with a count of 110.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.845
And, again, the filter was both.

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:31.780
So you can see that this is one potential solution for this,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.105
where it's telling me how long it took,

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:38.008
and it gives me a whole bunch of other information.

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.930
It says, "Would you like to see individual trip data?"

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.200
I say yes, and it gives me some information back.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.360
And then I can say no, and it says,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.950
"Would you like to restart?" And I'll say no.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.970
Cool. So that is one potential solution to this.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.942
Let's take a look at another one in a different example.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.530
It says, "Which one would you like to explore?"

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.680
So you can see they've built in this thing where it says,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.615
"It looks like you want to hear about Washington.

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:05.715
If that's not true, restart the program."

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:07.415
So they built in a check,

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:11.715
where it says it sort of builds in this filter of what they're going to do.

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:15.038
You can see that that was sort of done in the end of that other example,

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:16.695
but both of those are acceptable.

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.300
"Would you like to filter by day,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.995
month or not at all?"

00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:21.480
So let's just say,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.385
in this case, let's do month.

00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:25.275
"Which month do you want?"

00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:27.150
May.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.680
Cool. And so you can see that this one started calculating all those statistics,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.605
and you can see it was a little bit faster.

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:39.300
The way that it shows the information is a little bit different.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.465
So you can see it says,

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:42.120
"What's the breakdown of users?"

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.635
And that looks like this,

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:48.390
and "What is the most popular station?"

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.515
So the most popular start and end station and here's the count.

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:56.370
You can see what's the total traveling time done,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.625
and it gives it back in a little bit different format.

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:02.089
"What's the most popular hour of the day?"

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:03.420
It says 5.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.315
"What's the most popular day for traveling?" It's Wednesday.

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:11.880
So you can see that this one actually gave you a little bit less up front in terms of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.950
like how you're filtering and that was

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.595
because I only filtered by month and the other one filtered by both.

00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:19.048
So it says, "Would you like to restart?"

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:20.940
Let's just do a restart on this one.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.270
So it says, "Would you like to filter by which city?"

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.440
I'll say Chicago, and let's say I filter by day.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.665
So here notice that it says you can filter by this

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:35.445
based on not a number but like on one of these letter values.

00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:37.438
So I'm going to say Thursday,

00:04:37.438 --> 00:04:40.770
and then it calculates the information for me based on that filter.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.380
So again these are just two different ways to show the information at the end but,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.300
in general, it needs to be interactive,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.845
and it needs to show the statistics that are specified based on the rubric.

00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:55.490
And those are really the only two restrictions.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.440
So it should meet the rubric by giving

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.378
an interactive experience and calculating the statistics necessary,

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:04.410
but the template should just serve as a guide,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.110
and you should feel free to change that however

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.960
you think you want your program to interact with the user.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.540
Build in as much interactivity as you want to,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.945
and you should feel comfortable being creative in your solution.

00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:18.495
I hope this is helpful. Thanks for joining me.

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:20.890
Good luck with your projects.
