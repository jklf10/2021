00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
So, the first part of this is pretty simple.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.725
If you don't have a LinkedIn account,

00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:07.585
just follow the directions provided on the site and create your account.

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:09.990
If you've already created a Linkedin account,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
log in to it to follow along.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.929
The first thing you want to remember about profiles is that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.469
the five main things that show up when others first see you are: your name,

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.879
your picture, your headline,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.119
where you work, and your summary.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.870
All five of these items are critical to selling

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.719
yourself and making that good first impression.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.719
Your name should be good to go from the registration process as

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.850
long as you entered your real name in the registration form.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.609
For your profile picture,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.250
choose a professional photo that is clear and shows your face well.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.659
A profile picture should showcase you.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.789
If you have a brand you're marketing and you want to

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.155
use a logo instead of your profile picture,

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.679
it's better to create a LinkedIn company page for

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.670
that brand separate from your personal profile.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.960
Your picture is the part of your profile where

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.225
you start setting yourself apart from others.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:06.835
Avoid any photos that show you in compromising or unprofessional situations.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:11.634
In other words, no photos of smoking or beat shots and so on.

00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:17.245
The rule of thumb is would I do this in front of my new employer or in my new office.

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:19.075
Skipping ahead to where you work,

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:22.165
this should be filled in based on the experience section.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.235
If you're transitioning positions or career fields, put that in here.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:29.109
You can also put what career field you're trying to break into.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.105
So, if you're enrolled in the Data Analysts Nanodegree program,

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:35.980
put Data Analysts Nanodegree student.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.160
Now, let's move on to headline and summary sections.
