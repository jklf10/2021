00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
The headline section and the summary sections

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.540
are the most important part of your profile.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.754
This is where potential connections, corporate recruiters,

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:13.110
and anyone viewing your profile will get to know more about your previous experience,

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.289
skills, interests, and other vital information about you.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.969
The headline is the very first thing seen by another viewer.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.089
Your headline should be an attention grabber of how you would

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.225
get someone to stop and listen to what you have to say.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.730
Using keywords in your headline such as

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.039
full-stack web developer would be a great headline as it clearly states who you are,

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.189
and has multiple keywords for others to find you.

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:42.254
In this example, full-stack, web developer,

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.890
and full-stack web developer are three separate phrases that

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.564
can trigger recruiters word search and bringing it to their attention.

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:52.460
If you wanted a slightly more personable headline,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.270
you could put something like dedicated full-stack developer,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.345
bringing education into the 21st century.

00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:03.159
This headline doesn't have the number of keywords as the first headline,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.564
but it definitely puts a personalized spin to your introduction.

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:13.189
The best option for a headline is the job title you're currently applying to,

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.469
as this should give you the best chances of being recognized within that network.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.978
Now that you've gotten someone's attention,

00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:23.694
use your summary to tell them who you are,

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:26.669
what you've done, and what you're looking for.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.350
This is the best place to use your elevator speech.

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.394
If you created an effective speech,

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:34.769
it should pretty much addressed the who you are,

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:35.950
the what you've done,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.680
and what you're looking for.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.795
Part of what you've done is your work here with Udacity.

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:45.245
Use your classroom projects as part of your summary.

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:49.040
Your project shows that you have hands-on experience.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.630
Just like with any other form of education,

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:56.673
use your time at Udacity as a marketing tool to branch out into new networks.

00:01:56.674 --> 00:02:00.880
Add your Nano degree program with the rest of your education experience.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.859
Not only will using Udacity help you grow your network,

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.549
we also have hiring partners who are actively

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.865
searching for graduates to fill needed openings.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:13.129
Even if they aren't our hiring partners,

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.439
employers recognize the talent and hard work that is required to successfully complete

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.680
Nano degree programs here and are looking for

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.805
you to bring that talent and hard work to their organization.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.545
When writing your summary,

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:33.014
keep your experience and education down to three to five bullet statements if possible.

00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:36.139
If you have a long experience or education background,

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.284
use the examples to strategically position yourself for the role you want.

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:44.924
Don't just tell your story, sell your potential.

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:47.660
Wherever possible, use hard numbers and

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.280
quantifiable facts instead of using vague and general statements.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.520
Always use active language instead of passive.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.860
For example, the bullet statement,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.170
"Had created content for Career Services at you

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.159
Udacity to help students prepare for their job hunt,

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.560
networking, resume, and interviews in order to help

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.009
them find new jobs," can be rewarded for concreteness,

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.289
conciseness, and active language.

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.769
A better statement would sound something like,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.719
"Engaged 10,000 plus new students in

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.829
job search courses by improving content offerings on networking,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.105
job application, and interview best practices."

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:28.634
Not only does the second statement cut out filler words like,

00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:30.979
to help or in order to,

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:36.814
it also contains quantifiable numbers and action verbs like engaged and improving.

00:03:36.814 --> 00:03:40.430
Using these techniques will improve the strength of your summary and display

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.405
the experience and confidence gained from your past roles.

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.254
Many of the points I would make about writing a resume would

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:50.109
equally apply to grading the LinkedIn summary.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.570
The main difference between writing a resume and writing the summary

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.379
is that the summary is a narrative and considerably shorter.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.849
Choose your words carefully and concisely.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.064
Last but not least,

00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:09.560
place a call to action with your contact information at the end of your summary.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.594
Encourage the reader to reach out to you in whatever form you prefer,

00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:15.944
email, text, phone calls, et cetera.

00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:19.399
Don't let them leave your profile without compelling them

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.479
to want to contact you to discuss things in more detail.
