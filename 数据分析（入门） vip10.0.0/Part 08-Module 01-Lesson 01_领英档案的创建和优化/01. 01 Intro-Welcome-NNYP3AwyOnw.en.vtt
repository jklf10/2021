Hello. My name is Matt,

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:03.899
a Content Developer here at Udacity.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.115
I wanted to take a few minutes to talk with you about LinkedIn and networking.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.830
Networking is an essential and effective way to meet

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.859
and keep in touch with other people who share your interests.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.570
Whether you're connecting with thought leaders in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.954
your career field or being a mentor to others,

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:20.820
networking has the ability to raise your visibility to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.260
job recruiters and others looking to use your skills collaboratively.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
You may be actively working toward a promotion or you're looking for your first job.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.759
Some of you may also be trying to change into

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.939
career paths and break into a completely new industry.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.070
Wherever you may be in your career path,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.234
networking is the key to getting a great job that will fulfill you,

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:47.295
be more challenging, pay more or meet whatever your goals may be.

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:51.469
We all know the importance of the resume in finding a new job and how

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.884
crucial the first impression is to presenting yourself to interviewers and recruiters.

00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:59.949
LinkedIn provides a solution to both of these issues and more.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.370
LinkedIn has become one of

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.399
the most important tools you need to have when looking for a new job,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.885
expanding your network, helping people,

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:13.725
discovering more events or heightening your brand and presence in the industry.

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.199
When it comes to networking,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.040
you may have gotten advice to grow your network,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.625
but may not know the strategies to do so.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:24.799
This lesson is about giving you that missing strategy so that you can

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.700
expand your LinkedIn profile to help you in your networking goals.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.100
Back when I was looking for a new career before Udacity,

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.030
I resisted the idea of using my LinkedIn account during the job search.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.120
Connecting with people I didn't know was really awkward and frustrating.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.160
I thought that my time and energy would be better spent making sure my resume was

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.924
perfect or that I was ready for those interviews that would one day I had my way.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:51.754
Investing time into LinkedIn seem like a huge burden.

00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:54.944
However, I learned later that using LinkedIn

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.739
actually has a benefit of connecting me with peers and sharing knowledge,

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.439
helping me keep up to date on changes and innovation within my career field and opens

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.639
me up to many career opportunities not available from other sources like job boards.
