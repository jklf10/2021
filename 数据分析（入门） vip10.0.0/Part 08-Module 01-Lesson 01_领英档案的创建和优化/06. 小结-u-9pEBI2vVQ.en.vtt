00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
I know how frustrating,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.320
daunting, and in some cases,

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.519
demoralizing it is to have to go through

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.059
the whole process of creating an account and building the network.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.325
It can be hard to put yourself out there.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:14.099
Like many of you, I didn't see the value in investing

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.195
so much time and energy into nurturing my LinkedIn account,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.170
but as I continued my job search,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.070
I kept seeing how more and more potential employers

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.234
were asking for LinkedIn profile URLs.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:30.175
Several of my applications could have been submitted solely on LinkedIn,

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:31.820
if I had wanted to do so,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.625
yet still I resisted.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.700
Almost an entire year later,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.420
I was still actively looking for a job and was just about to the end of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.545
my sanity when I finally stumbled across this role with Udacity.

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:47.965
I applied for this position and literally one day later received an email from

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:53.000
LinkedIn advertising the exact same position. I'm not alone.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.939
According to Udacity's research,

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.960
one in four people don't network at all.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.240
I am convinced that had I worked on my LinkedIn account more often,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.659
I would have found this job sooner than I did.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.879
Here at Udacity, we even did some research and found that

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.920
85% of job openings are filled through networking.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.420
Eighty five percent, with recruiters relying more heavily on LinkedIn,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.100
and the ease of creating quality networks that can

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.515
provide so much opportunity for growth and change,

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.549
having a LinkedIn profile can significantly

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.539
impact your job search and help you find your dream job.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.890
