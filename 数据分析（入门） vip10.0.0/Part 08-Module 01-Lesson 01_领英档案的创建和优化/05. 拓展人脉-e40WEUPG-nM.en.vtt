00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.459
The whole point of LinkedIn is to connect to or make a network

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:08.189
of peers and other professionals for the purpose of collaboration.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.704
Whether this collaboration is based on mutual interest projects, mentorship,

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.914
extra-curricular activities or job prospects,

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:19.384
networking is your main task when using LinkedIn.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:23.040
The site does a great job of helping you get your network started,

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.655
making it grow and providing a constant barrage of new potential contacts.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:29.165
As your network grows,

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:31.629
it will begin to look something like this.

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.545
Each time you make a connection,

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:35.045
you uncover more connections,

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:38.340
which will lead to multiple levels or degrees of contacts.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.845
LinkedIn labels these levels is first,

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:43.359
second, third degree connections.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.420
First degree connections are the actual connections you have made with people.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.215
They will be your network.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.755
Second degree connections are people

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.545
with whom your first degree connections connected with.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:58.085
You can think of second degree connections as friends of friends.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:00.640
Third degree connections, you can guess,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.435
are connections of second degree connections

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:06.829
LinkedIn will show all of these connections and you can connect with,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.683
message or interact with any of these connections at anytime.

00:01:10.683 --> 00:01:14.875
These individuals can also interact and see you as well.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.890
This interaction between levels is what will allow recruiters to find you.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.064
However, as this graphic shows,

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:22.674
the more you grow your network,

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:25.579
the more challenging it becomes to make your profile stand

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.810
out because you're being connected to an exponential number of connections.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.350
That said, the first five elements of your profile are

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:37.454
the make or break for grabbing attention and selling to a recruiter,

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:42.739
colleague, friend or anyone on taking more time to look into your profile in more detail.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.954
You aren't trying to sell yourself in two,

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:46.250
three or four seconds,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.930
you just need to get them to click on

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.130
your profile so they can get the rest of your story.

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.049
One of our curriculum leads here at Udacity even got

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.369
her job by old colleague of hers posting it on LinkedIn,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.380
even though it wasn't advertised anywhere else.

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.349
There are a few tactics you can use to expand your professional network.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.509
Connecting to organizations such as

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.490
Udacity Alumni Network or a specific nano-degree program LinkedIn group,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.175
such as Udacity VR Developer Nano-Degree can quickly boost your network into new areas.

00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:20.960
Examine second and third degree connections.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.830
Find connections that can apply to and assist you in your network expansion.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.205
Investigate companies you'd like to work for or are in your targeted interest area.

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:34.020
Find the recruiters and cold call them.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.460
Using cold calls in LinkedIn is simply sending these new people

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.170
a connection invite with a message declaring your interest in them,

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.689
their company, their field, et cetera.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.734
Be polite, respectful and direct.

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.760
Ask for informative interviews or who you can connect

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.149
with in order to get information or job opportunities.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.145
People like being needed.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:58.425
Use these techniques and make those connections.

00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:02.390
For example, let's say I'm looking to start a career in deep learning.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.729
I find a second degree connection that works at

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:08.239
a large software developing company in their deep learning department.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.975
I would send them a connection request with a message like "Hi.

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:14.539
My name is Matt. I'm currently trying to change

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.299
careers into the software industry, specifically deep learning.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.110
I would love to connect with you and discuss any advice you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.915
may have to make this transition a reality.

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:25.824
Hope to hear from you soon."

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:30.174
This is one way to make use of your connections to get info on positions,

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:35.469
required skills, new contacts among other vital networking information.

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.849
In all of our research into this topic here at Udacity,

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.729
we have found that the number one boost to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.569
your job search is your network and networking skills.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.079
In fact, there are many more jobs only available through

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.200
networking than there are advertised on job posting sites.
