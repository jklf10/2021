00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.180
Just like last lesson, you'll be
able to complete all the programming

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.000
exercises for
this lesson on the Udacity website.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.910
But the data is available in the
downloadable section in case you'd like

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.410
to explore it further.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.330
Again, I'll be focusing on NumPy and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.010
Panda's rather than going through
the data analysis process in order.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.139
But I still want you to
start by asking questions.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.490
So download the description of the data
from the downloadable section,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.320
then think of at least five questions
you could answer with this data and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.890
share them on the forums.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.630
When you're finished, check these boxes.
