00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.530
To write the convert_grades function
I'll first write a function that

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.000
converts a single grade, and

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.220
then I can apply that function
to the entire data frame.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.620
I'll call the singular version
of the function convert_grade.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.280
I wrote this function using
a series of if statements.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
First, if the grade was at
least 90 then I returned A,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.480
then if the grade was at least
80 I returned B and so on.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.470
Now I'll try this function
out on a few single values.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
If I convert the grade 80, I get B.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.180
And if I convert 79, I get C,
which is what I expected.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.870
Next I can use the applymap function

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.270
to call the convert_grade function
on each element of the data frame.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.250
Now I'll call this function on
the example grid's data frame and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.130
it looks like it worked.
