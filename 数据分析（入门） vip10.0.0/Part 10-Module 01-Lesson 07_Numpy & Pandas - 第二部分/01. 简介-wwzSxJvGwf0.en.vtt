00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.700
In the last lesson you used NumPy and
Pandas to analyze one dimensional data.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.970
In this lesson, you'll learn a lot more
features of both libraries that you can

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.100
use to analyze two dimensional data.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.460
By the end of the lesson, you'll be able
to rewrite a lot of the codes that you

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.510
wrote in lesson one but this time using
Pandas and if you're wondering why I'm

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.760
wearing this shirt, it's because you'll
also be working with a new data set this

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.530
lesson containing subway ridership and
weather data for New York City.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.160
Let's get started.
