00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.530
I decided to make a plot of subway
ridership by day of the week.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.980
The first thing I wanted to do
was take a look at the data and

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.490
remind myself where that
information was stored.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.050
And I can see here that it's
in the day_week column.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.590
So the first thing I'm going to
do is group the subway data by

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.170
the day of the week.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.470
And as before, this gives me
a data frame grouped by object so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.860
I can't really see what's going on yet.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.960
Next, I want to take the mean
ridership for each day of the week, so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570
I'll add .mean.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.240
This time, I can see some results.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.590
This is showing me the mean value of
each column for each day of the week.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.500
I'm specifically interested in
the ENTRIESn_hourly column, so

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.860
I'll look at that one.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.650
And then running this again, I see
a series containing only the values for

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.760
the ENTRIESn_hourly column.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.930
And I'll name this
series ridership_by_day.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.400
Next I'm ready to make
a plot of these values.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.330
As usual I'll use %pylab inline to
make sure the plots appear within

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.350
the notebook and import seaborn as sns
to make my plots look a little nicer.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.724
Next, I'll call ridership_by_day.plot.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.010
And this is the plot I get.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.080
The most striking I notice is that
the ridership is significantly

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.800
lower on days 5 and
6 than during the rest of the week.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.180
Days 5 and 6 are Saturday and
Sunday, so this makes sense.
