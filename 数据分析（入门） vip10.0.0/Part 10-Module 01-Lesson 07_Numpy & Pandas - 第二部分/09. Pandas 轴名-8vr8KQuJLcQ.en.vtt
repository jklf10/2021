00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.660
Just like NumPy, many Panda's
functions also take an axis argument.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.050
And you can use axis = 0 or
axis = 1, like for NumPy,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.000
but you can also use axis = index or
axis = columns.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.250
Now this sounds like it should make
it easier to remember which version

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.300
of the axis argument is which, but
it can actually be pretty confusing.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.320
Taking the mean with axis equals
columns will actually not

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.910
give the mean of each column.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.490
Instead it gives the mean of each row.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.710
The idea is that you are taking
the mean along the columns.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.850
Similarly with axis = index, you
are taking the mean along the index, or

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.410
the rows.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.930
I still have trouble remembering which
way the axis argument will work, so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.220
again I always try it out in iPython and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.060
see what happens before
I use the argument.
