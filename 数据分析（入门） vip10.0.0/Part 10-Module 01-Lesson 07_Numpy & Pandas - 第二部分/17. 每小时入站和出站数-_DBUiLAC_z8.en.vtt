00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
I'll use the function I wrote earlier as a starting point since that will be

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.875
the code to calculate the hourly entries and exits for a single group.

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:10.215
This time I've named the function hourly_for_group.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:14.515
Now, the first thing you'll need to do is group the ridership DataFrame by unit.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:18.245
As usual, this gives the DataFrameGroupBy object.

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:22.325
Now, it might seem logical to apply the hourly_for_group function at this point.

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.915
However, if I try this,

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.040
I get a message that says,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.315
"TypeError: unsupported operands type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'."

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.550
The reason this is happening,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.490
is Pandas is trying to apply the hourly_for_group function to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.840
each column of the DataFrame including the unit and time columns.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.670
Since these columns contain strings,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.020
the function doesn't work on them.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.165
You can't subtract a string from a string.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:47.000
To fix this, I need to select just the entries

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.105
and exits columns before applying this function.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:53.530
Once I've done that, the function works as expected.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.875
This time, I see two rows of NaNs,

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:57.325
one for each station.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:58.635
That's because for each station,

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:02.460
there was one row where there was no previous row to compare it to.
