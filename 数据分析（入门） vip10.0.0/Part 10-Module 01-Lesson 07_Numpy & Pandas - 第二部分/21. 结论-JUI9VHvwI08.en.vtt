00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.890
Congratulations, you've
finished the course.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.710
Hopefully, you've made some

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.640
interesting discoveries about
the New York subway data.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.286
At this point,

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:10.376
you know how to go through the data
analysis process from start to finish.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:14.677
And you can use NumPy's and Pandas to
write data analysis code that's clean,

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.970
concise, and runs quickly.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.280
Great job.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.970
I hope you've enjoyed taking this course
as much as I enjoyed creating it.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.530
I want to hear your thoughts.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.980
Please write a forum post sharing what
were your favorite parts of the course

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.507
and what suggestions do you have for
how to improve it.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.010
And by the way for

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.120
some extra fun check out the pandas
links in the instructor notes.
