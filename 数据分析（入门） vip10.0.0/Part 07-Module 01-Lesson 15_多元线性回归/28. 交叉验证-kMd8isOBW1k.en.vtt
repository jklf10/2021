00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.530
In the last video,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.710
I discussed how simply adding more and more variables to our model,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.379
will lead to better R-squared in MSC values,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.245
which introduced this idea of cross validation.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.149
In cross validation, we train

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
our regression model on a subset of the data, called the training data.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.859
And we test how well the model performs on what is known as a test set.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.070
In cross validation, we try to make sure that our model

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
generalize as well by performing these splits multiple times.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.189
Sebastian will show you how this works step by step,

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:35.000
and then we'll try it out in Python.
